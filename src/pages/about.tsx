          programming in 2017 and learned how to program in 2018 starting with
          Javascript after being inspired by one of my friends online named

        <h2>How did I got involved with the Furry Community</h2>
        <p>
          Furries are something I wouldn{"'"}t imagine myself to be in... back
          in 2019. During 2019 I discovered furries from a YouTube video of a
          person joining furry servers and troll in them, when watching the
          video it kinda made me look at the fandom and their behavior in a
          weird/bad way. this used to be a topic I like to bother people with, I
          did some research about furries late 2019 I did expressed a little
          interest about the furry community. I liked the Artworks, Creations, a
          bit about the community. When the pandemic was a big deal I continued
          researching about furries and kinda made me expressed my interest a
          lot more so I decided to join furry servers and kinda see how is it I
          then ended up making my Sona my YouTube Channel Mascot and kinda went
          from there. The Community is nice and welcoming and the fandom is
          really amazing. Despite &quot;yiff&quot; which people gets confused
          about the fandom thinking it was some sort of fetish It is like a
          community of people who has a chracter that can resprent themselves
          online you could say. On December 31 2020 I made my very own Sona
          named vulpo which is a Dragon/Fox Hybird and on April I made my second
          sona named Renzo who is a Racoon, Fox, and Dragon Hybird
