# Ozzy Website
![Preview of the design of the website](public/banner.png)

## Information about the website
This is the **5th** Major version of my personal website. In this version I said, fuck it. We'll be simple and less complicated. I started using tailwind. For projects and blogs it'll be under sanity.io an awesome CMS I recommend. Each section is their own page rather than all in the home page. Took away the furry parts of my personal website (might put it back, we'll see).

## What's new in this major version
- 🧾 Sentry for Projects and Blogs
